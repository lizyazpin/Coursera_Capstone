# Coursera_Capstone

This is a project for completing the “Applied Data Science Capstone” IBM course from Coursera. It includes the assignment of analyzing neighborhoods in Toronto by using Foursquare API (Neighborhoods-Toronto.ipynb) and the final project. 

The final project analyzed the low and high risk areas of Mexico City to find a location for an international restaurant, specifically a Jamaican restaurant. The risks taken into account are violence and natural disasters. The natural disasters considered are earthquakes and flooding.

The final project files include a source of data (Data_source.ipynb), a report (Jamaican_restaurant_in_Mexico_City-Report.ipynb) and a presentation (Selecting_best_area_for_a_Jamaican_restaurant%20in.pps).
